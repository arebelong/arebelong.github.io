Shamelessly stolen from collegue. 

A few tips
	Make sure the slidemaster is in the language you want (view|slide master)
	You can change language of all text in a presentation by
	Go to outline view (view|outline view)
	Select all the text on the left
	Ctrl A
	Change language (review|language|set proofing language)

This kinda sorts the problem

I do experience still from time to time that stuff (sneaks in) in Danish as well for some reason

I suspect it is left-over stuff from earlier

Problems often come with decks that are copy/pasted from many sources. If you paste with (preserve original formatting) you will also copy in Danish language templates into your master view
