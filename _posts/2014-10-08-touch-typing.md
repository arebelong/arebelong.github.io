Today I decided to focus on practicing my touch typing skills. I found this website which I will use for the next month to see if it can help me improve my speed and accuracy. 

[Typing study](http://www.typingstudy.com/da-danish-2/speedtest)

An alternative if could be this site. Typing clubs look quite nice but they dont support Danish keyboard layout :(
[Typing Club](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en/keys-jf.html)

But first a speedtest so I have a baseline :) I disliked the test on Typing study so found this test instead.
