At my current project we use a tool called [Custom Item Generator](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/en/Modules/Custom_Item_Generator.aspx) to generate all the classes based on a subset of the templates in Sitecore. 

I was using one of the autogenerated classes the other day and found a somewhat unexpected behavior that led me to have a bug and now to have written this blog post :) 

I needed to change the code from using the name of a property to using the value of this property instead. I expected to change the code to use the Text property instead of the Name property. 

Testing and everything worked fineâ€¦.except it didn't. The problem shows when the user is in edit mode. When in edit mode the value of the Text field is not the value of the item but instead the html for allowing a user to edit the item in a browser, not what I expected. 

The fix was simple I needed to use the Raw property instead which does not change the value of an item to html when the user is in edit mode. 

Lessons learned thorough testing is good and when using the Custom Item Generator tool careful about using the Text property, properly you want to use the Raw property instead J
